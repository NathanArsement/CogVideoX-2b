## Quick Start ü§ó

This model supports deployment using the huggingface diffusers library. You can deploy it by following these steps.

**We recommend that you visit our [GitHub](https://github.com/THUDM/CogVideo) and check out the relevant prompt
optimizations and conversions to get a better experience.**

1. Install the required dependencies

```shell
pip install --upgrade opencv-python transformers 
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers.git@878f609aa5ce4a78fea0f048726889debde1d7e8#egg=diffusers # Still in PR
```

2. Run the code

```python
import torch
from diffusers import CogVideoXPipeline
from diffusers.utils import export_to_video

prompt = "A panda, dressed in a small, red jacket and a tiny hat, sits on a wooden stool in a serene bamboo forest. The panda's fluffy paws strum a miniature acoustic guitar, producing soft, melodic tunes. Nearby, a few other pandas gather, watching curiously and some clapping in rhythm. Sunlight filters through the tall bamboo, casting a gentle glow on the scene. The panda's face is expressive, showing concentration and joy as it plays. The background includes a small, flowing stream and vibrant green foliage, enhancing the peaceful and magical atmosphere of this unique musical performance."

pipe = CogVideoXPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "THUDM/CogVideoX-2b",
    torch_dtype=torch.float16
).to("cuda")

prompt_embeds, _ = pipe.encode_prompt(
    prompt=prompt,
    do_classifier_free_guidance=True,
    num_videos_per_prompt=1,
    max_sequence_length=226,
    device="cuda",
    dtype=torch.float16,
)

video = pipe(
    num_inference_steps=50,
    guidance_scale=6,
    prompt_embeds=prompt_embeds,
).frames[0]

export_to_video(video, "output.mp4", fps=8)
```

**Using a single A100 GPU, generating a video with the above configuration takes approximately 90 seconds**

If the generated model appears ‚Äúall green‚Äù and not viewable in the default MAC player, it is a normal phenomenon (due to
OpenCV saving video issues). Simply use a different player to view the video.

## Explore the Model

Welcome to our [github](https://github.com/THUDM/CogVideo), where you will find:

1. More detailed technical details and code explanation.
2. Optimization and conversion of prompt words.
3. Reasoning and fine-tuning of SAT version models, and even pre-release.
4. Project update log dynamics, more interactive opportunities.
5. CogVideoX toolchain to help you better use the model.
